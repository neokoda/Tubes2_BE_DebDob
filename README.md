## DebDob Wikirace's Website API

- This website API is created by Team DebDob, consisting of Nuel, Neo, and Dabbir, as part of our second major assignment for the Algorithm Strategies course. The website implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) algorithms to find the shortest path from one Wikipedia article to another. We hope you enjoy exploring it!

## Breadth First Search (BFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores graphs and trees level-by-level, visiting all nodes at a given depth before moving deeper. It uses a queue for tracking nodes to visit, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. BFS has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, and it's often used for level-order traversal or identifying connected components. This approach ensures every node is explored in the shortest possible time, making it a key tool in various applications.
## Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) is a hybrid approach combining depth-first and breadth-first strategies. IDS performs depth-limited depth-first searches, increasing the depth limit incrementally with each iteration. This method is especially useful when the depth of the graph is unknown, providing a way to explore without high memory usage. With a time complexity akin to BFS and lower space complexity, IDS is commonly applied in puzzle-solving, game trees, and other contexts where depth is uncertain. This iterative process allows for more efficient exploration in large or deep structures, making it versatile for different search-related problems
